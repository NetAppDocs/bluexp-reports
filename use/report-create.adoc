You can create a volumes report that shows the number of files, files in directories, symbolic links, hard links (for non-SMB protocol), largest file sizes, allocated capacity, and more. 

Each time you create a report, the BlueXP migration reports service scans the path and compiles the data. Using the same report definition, you can have multiple instances of that report. 

The BlueXP migration reports service shows data by volumes.

You can generate only one report at a time. 

You can also download the report as a PDF file. 

TIP: All BlueXP migration reports operations are listed in the BlueXP Timeline. To see the Timeline, select BlueXP *Settings* > *Timeline*. 

.Steps 

. From the BlueXP left nav, select *Storage* > *Migration reports*.
